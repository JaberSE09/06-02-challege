## Description

Use the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities. Built this weather app to demonstrate the use of server side API throgh JavaScript. This app solves the problem of finding the weather for a city amd being able to store it in a localstorage to be called to in search history. I learned how to create a web application that uses third party API to display data from a json object.
